                        <li>  A Coin Wallet has been provided to you wherein your Digital Assets may be stored. You agree and understand that Coin Wallet Services are provided by third party custody service providers, with their own applicable cyber security and data protection norms.

                     <h3>
                        RISKS
                     </h3>
                     <ol class="docx-ul">
                        <li> The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk . Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Such price fluctuations may increase or decrease the value of your assets at any given moment. Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.
                        </li>
                        <li> Virtual Asset and Digital Asset trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are a unique type of asset, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can issue more cryptocurrency or take corrective measures to protect the value of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets in a crisis.
                        </li>
                        <li> Instead, Virtual Assets and Digital Assets are an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated global system of cryptocurrency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.
                        </li>
                        <li> The trading of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets is often susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence in Virtual Assets and Digital Assets might collapse because of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.
                        </li>
                        <li> There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.
                        </li>
                        <li> You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Virtual Assets or Digital Assets.
                        </li>
                        <li> We use our banking providers in order to facilitate the receipt of fiat currency from Members and payments to other Members. Our banking providers DO NOT transfer, exchange or provide any services in connection with Virtual Assets or Digital Assets. Your fiat currency will be held in a bank account in the name of Wealthmark together with other Members' fiat currency. 
                        </li>
                        <li> We engage with third-party custodians in order to hold Virtual Assets and Digital Assets on your behalf. Your Virtual Assets and Digital Assets will be held on your behalf in a wallet in the name of Wealthmark together with other Members’ Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets. They may also from time to time be held in the wallet together with Wealthmark’s Virtual Assets and/or Digital Assets which reflect Wealthmark’s fees, but which are recorded on Wealthmark’s ledger as belonging to Wealthmark, and which you instruct Wealthmark to collect by withdrawing them from the wallet. We will maintain detailed records of all Virtual Assets and Digital Assets which Members hold with third-party custodians appointed by us.
                        </li>
                        <li> As set out above, Wealthmark will act only on your Instructions in respect of Virtual Assets and Digital Assets, and does not otherwise acquire any right, title or interest in them. Whilst Wealthmark uses reasonable care in the appointment of third-party custodians, in the event of a third-party custodian becoming insolvent or entering into an insolvency process in a relevant jurisdiction, you may have only an unsecured claim against the third-party custodian, and Members' Virtual Assets or Digital Assets may be at risk subject to any protections provided at law in the relevant jurisdiction.</li>
                     </ol>
